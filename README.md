# DECIDE - Powering Educational Change Through Crowdsourced Solutions

## Overview
DECIDE is a Web3-powered platform that enables students, educators, and innovators to **propose, vote on, and get rewarded** for solutions that tackle **real educational challenges**. By leveraging **blockchain technology**, DECIDE brings **transparency, democracy, and financial incentives** to the process of improving education.
